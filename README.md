# Unified Suite for Experiments

## Overview

USE (Unified Suite for Experiments) is a complete software and hardware
suite for the development, control, and preliminary analysis of dynamic,
video-game-like behavioural neuroscience experiments.

The scripts available here include the USE_Core, which extend the
functionality of the Unity video game engine to support USE, a set of
tutorial examples, and Matlab parsing and analysis
scripts. See the wiki for tutorials and overviews.
